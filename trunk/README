Loki Patch Tools 1.0


Introduction
============
This is a set of tools written by Loki Software, Inc., designed to
create a set of binary patches that can be easily used either by
themselves or in conjunction with the Loki Update Tool.

This update tool is available for use under the GNU General Public License.


How To Create A Patch
=====================

 * Create a directory for your patch source files:

     mkdir upgrade
     cd upgrade

 * Create binary and data directories for the original files. e.g: 

     mkdir bin-1.54a-x86 data-1.54a

 * Create binary and data directories for the new files, e.g: 

     mkdir bin-1.54b-x86 data-1.54b

 * Copy the appropriate files into the directories, e.g.: 

    cp /usr/local/games/rt2.old/rt2 bin-1.54a-x86/rt2
    cp /usr/local/games/rt2.new/rt2 bin-1.54b-x86/rt2

    cp /usr/local/games/rt2.old/default2.lng data-1.54a/
    cp /usr/local/games/rt2.new/default2.lng data-1.54b/

 * Copy the patch README into the new data directory, e.g: 

    cp /usr/local/games/rt2.new/README-1.54b data-1.54b/README-1.54b

 * Copy the patch tools image directory to a new patch directory tree, e.g: 

    cp -av ~/loki_patch/image rt2-1.54b-x86

 * Generate deltas of the binaries and data files. 

     make_patch rt2-1.54b-x86/patch.dat delta-install bin-1.54a-x86 bin-1.54b-x86
     make_patch rt2-1.54b-x86/patch.dat delta-install data-1.54a-x86 data-1.54b-x86

   The make_patch tool is very flexible, run it without any options to see a list of commands that it recognizes. 

 * Customize the patch description file, patch.dat, if necessary, e.g.

     vi rt2-1.54b-x86/patch.dat

 * Copy the README into the patch directory, e.g: 

     cp data-1.54b/README-1.54b rt2-1.54b-x86/README.txt

   This file is shown to the user before they apply the patch. 

 * Pack the patch archive, e.g: 

     makeself.sh rt2-1.54b-x86 rt2-1.54b-x86.run "Railroad Tycoon II 1.54b update" ./apply-patch.sh

 * Test the patch on a fresh install, e.g: 

     # remove old versions, install from CD, patch up to current level
     sh rt2-1.54b-x86.run

 * Generate the GPG signature, named patch.sig, e.g: 

     gpg --secret-keyring /mnt/cdrom/secring.gpg --detach-sign rt2-1.54b-x86.run

 * Generate the MD5 checksum, named patch.md5, e.g: 

     md5sum rt2-1.54b-x86.run >rt2-1.54b-x86.run.md5

 * Generate the README, named patch.txt, e.g: 

     cp rt2-1.54b-x86/README.txt rt2-1.54b-x86.run.txt

 * Generate the Loki Update Tool entry for the patch, e.g:

     loki_patch --info rt2-1.54b-x86/patch.dat >>updates.txt

 * Copy the patch to your public relase directory and you're done!
