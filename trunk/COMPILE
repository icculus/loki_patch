loki_patch uses a local (and patched) version of
xdelta 1.1.3, it is included here. Additionally,
you need libxml (latest is 1.8.17, not libxml2),
and glib-1.2 (latest is 1.2.10).

Here are the steps to compile loki_patch:

1. Extract the xdelta tarball:

  # tar xvfz libs/xdelta-1.1.3-patched.tar.gz

2. Compile xdelta  as usual (./configure and make)

3. Configure and compile loki_setupdb (which should
   normally reside in ../loki_setupdb !)

3. Now you're ready to compile loki_setup:

   # sh autogen.sh
   # ./configure
   # make
