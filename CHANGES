 * Added an environment variable LOKI_PATCH_UNSAFE
   - If this is set to "1", then it will use less diskspace for patches,
     but if a patch fails, it will corrupt your installation.
   - If this is set to "2", then not enough diskspace is not fatal.
   - If this is set to "3", then most errors will not stop the patch.
