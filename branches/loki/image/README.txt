Change this file to the README for your product patch

In order to generate a patch, you should also edit the "patch.dat" file
and add your patch information to the header.  If you need pre/post patch
scripts, you can edit the appropriately named scripts in this directory
as well.

To actually apply the patch, have the user run the apply-patch.sh shell
script.  At Loki we have this run automatically by using the makeself
archive packing script: http://www.lokigames.com/~megastep/makeself/

Enjoy!
